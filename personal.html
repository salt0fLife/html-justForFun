    the doctor was a character I created for a short Film that never got made.
    It was going to feature The Doctor and his friend The Monster going through
    the world with a suprisingly wholesome outlook on everything.
    <br>
    As previously stated, the film was never completed. All I managed to complete was this 
    test version of the doctors rig, a static textured mesh of monster, 
    and the first shot of the whole film.

    *first shot of the film* (the fox rig was only intended for this one shot, and there are so many issues I wont include it here)

    <h4>High Isle Knight</h4>
    <hr>
    I Made this character because I was really into elderscrolls online at the time, and I thought he didnt get enough screen time in the trailers. So I modeled and rigged a version of him
    as close to the origional that I could.

    <h4>MetaKnight Render</h4>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <br>
    I told a highschool friend that the MetaKnight model in Smash Bros Ultimate wouldn't be difficult to make, and to prove my point I made This
    the jokes on me thought because It turns out he was much harder to model than I initially thought and It took me a full two weekends.
