  to get the surface details I wanted, I sculpted a very high poly version of his head, body and front legs
  in blender, and baked the normal information to the low poly mesh.

    the doctor was a character I created for a short Film that never got made.
    It was going to feature The Doctor and his friend The Monster going through
    the world with a suprisingly wholesome outlook on everything.
    <br>
    As previously stated, the film was never completed. All I managed to complete was this 
    test version of the doctors rig, a static textured mesh of monster, 
    and the first shot of the whole film.
    <br>

    <br>
    *first shot of the film* (the fox rig was only intended for this one shot, and there are so many issues I wont include it here)

    *monster* (he is actually fairly low poly, the detail is baked normals from his sculpted version)

    <h4>High Isle Knight</h4>
    <hr>
    I Made this character during A time where I played a lot of Elderscrolls Online. He was featured in a couple of their trailers, but I thought he didnt get enough screen time. So I modeled and rigged a version of him
    as close to the origional that I could.
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    I even had a shortfilm planned for him, but I was still In highschool and it was just to ambitius a project for me at the time.
    <br>
    I did get these shots set up however

    <h4>MetaKnight Render</h4>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <br>
    There is a story behind this one.
    <br>
    a number of years ago I pridefully told one of my highschool friends that MetaKnight from the game Smash bros Ultimate would be easy to model. I was not beleived, so to prove my point I made this.
    Im not sure it proved the point however, because It turned out he was much harder to model than I initially thought and It took me a full two weekends to complete.

    <h4>Fear Me Burrito</h4>
    <hr>
    <br>
    My friends and I played a lot of Throw Throw Burrito for a while, and I modeled the mascot and 3d Printed a massive version as a trophy for our group.
    The model was to just halarious not to render.

    <h4>Expanse</h4>
    <hr>
    expanse is a game Ive been working a lot on in my own freetime. its my big personal project right now. Unfortunately I dont have too many interesting things to show for it.
    It is a multiplayer game made with a Godot Steam custom build. So I am always trying to get the technical side to work first and art comes second.
    that being said, I have still made a variety of models and animations for it, though they are still rather rough. lacking that final polish that A finished product would get.
