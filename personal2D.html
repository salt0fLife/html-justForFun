    I have always had a love hate relationship with sprites. they are super cool, very easy on your hardware, and can look like whatever you want. But in the end they are 
    always so time consuming. 
    <br>
    I have tried a variety of methods over the years, some as straightforward as the monstrocity above, and others 
    more interesting and complicated

    this little guy was drawn in peices and hand animated in engine. 
    The benefit of this over Traditional sprite andimation was that I could smooth out the transition between
    animations preceduraly as most of the in engine animations relied on changing the local transform of peices.

    he is also fully unsaturated to allow for modulation and custom colors.

    *A Side Note* the game he is in never got released as I was the only person working on it, so I never finished more than whats in the video.

    in this example I was peiceing a character together like a lego person, and using the sprites to simulate 3D
    rotation in each limb. I also created normal maps for each frame to simulate 3d lighting in a 2d game.
    while I did create sprites and their normals for every single component, I did not ever get to animating the character
    in engine.
