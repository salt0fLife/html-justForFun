This model is named Jerry and played the part of our games mildly annoying enemy. He is comprised of 45,712 triangles in 26 objects controlled by 89 bones and mapped with two image textures.
All modeling and rigging was done In Blender, the sidePanelWood texture I drew in krita and the eyeTexture was made from noise in blenders shader editor and baked to a texture.
He was pretty much the main character of the game, as it was first person with no player model. so just I wanted him to look as good as possible.
